# Single Handwritten Numerical Digit Classification
Numerical image classification using Convolutional Neural Network, illustrating the complete machine learning pipeline with PyTorch.


## Overview
- Task: Numerical Image Classification (from 0 to 9)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Challenges: Building a CNN model from scratch, training the model and implementing an interactive demonstration


## Demonstration
- A demonstration of the model is produced at HuggingFace Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Fuyuki0312/ModelDetectingNumber-demo
- You may need to restart the space in order to use the model.
- Note: Input images are grayscale and their background color should be white by default.

## How to use this model
- If you wish to continue to train the model which was already trained by me, you may consider to run the file train.py with file ModelDetectingNumber.pth and file model.py being in the same address. Besides, if you wish to implement a completely new model, you only need delete or move file ModelDetectingNumber.pth away.

## Limitation
- Model usually gives right predictions only when the background color of input images is white because this model was trained primarily on numerical images with white backgrounds.
- If the input image is not so clear, the model may confidently produce a wrong prediction.


## Possible Improvements
- Expanding the dataset to include numerical images with diverse backgrounds (dark, textured, etc).
- Applying background-related data augmentation techniques during training.
